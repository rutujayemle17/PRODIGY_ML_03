# 🐱 Cat vs. Dog Classifier using SVM 🐶

## 📜 Description

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** to classify images of cats and dogs using the [Dogs vs. Cats dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images/data) from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between these two popular pets, showcasing the capabilities of machine learning in image recognition tasks.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques to resize, normalize, and augment the dataset for improved model performance.
- **SVM Implementation**: A robust classification model using SVM, capable of achieving high accuracy.
- **Performance Visualization**: Graphical representation of model accuracy and decision boundaries for better insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for this project.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the SVM algorithm and other machine learning tasks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and preprocessing.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
 
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cat-vs-dog-classifier.git
 

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
  
   cd cat-vs-dog-classifier


3. **Install the required packages**:
  
   pip install -r requirements.txt


4. **Download the dataset from Kaggle** [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chetankv/dogs-cats-images/data) and place the images in the appropriate directory.

5. **Run the main script**:
 
   python main.py


## 📈 Usage

Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new images of cats and dogs. Simply place your images in the specified directory and run the classification script.
