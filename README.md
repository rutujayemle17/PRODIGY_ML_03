Cat vs. Dog Classifier using SVM üê±üê∂

Description
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs using a dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between these two popular pets, showcasing the capabilities of machine learning in image recognition tasks.

Key Features
Image Preprocessing: Techniques to resize, normalize, and augment the dataset for improved model performance.
SVM Implementation: A robust classification model using SVM, capable of achieving high accuracy.
Performance Visualization: Graphical representation of model accuracy and decision boundaries for better insights.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for this project.
Scikit-learn: For implementing the SVM algorithm and other machine learning tasks.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
Matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizations.
Pandas: For data handling and preprocessing.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/rutujayemle17/PRODIGY_ML_03.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd cat-vs-dog-classifier

Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script:
python main.py

Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify new images of cats and dogs. Simply place your images in the specified directory and run the classification script.
